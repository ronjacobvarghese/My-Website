## Requirements:

- Node JS
- Backend Database (SQL, MongoDB(slightly different))

## Dependencies:

- Prisma
- Typescript
- ts-node(typescript definitions for node)
- @Types/node (same as above point)
- Nodemon

```jsx
npm i -D prisma typescript ts-node @types/node nodemon
```

```jsx
npx prisma init --datasource-provider #database
```

- Be sure to set up your environmental variables such as DATABASE_URL with your
  appropriate database
- To run programs, let's add a new script to our package.json file. We'll create
  a script called "dev" that utilizes `nodemon` to automatically compile and
  rerun our script.ts file whenever we make changes. Here's how you can define
  the "dev" script in your package.json:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon script.ts"
  }
  ```
  With this script in place, you can start your development environment using:
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```
  Nodemon will watch for changes in your "script.ts" file and automatically
  restart the application, making the development process smoother and more
  efficient.

### Prisma Generator

```jsx
generator client{
	provider: "prisma-client-js",
}

datasource db {
provider = "mysql"
url = en("DATABASE_URL")
relationMode = "prisma"
}
```

- In Prisma, a generator is a feature that automates the generation of code and
  files based on your data model and schema. Instead of writing traditional SQL
  or NoSQL queries, you define your database schema in a specific Prisma format,
  which is separate from other database query languages.
- When you use a generator, you specify how you want the Prisma-defined schema
  to be transformed into actual code or files. For most projects, the default
  generator is "prisma-client-js," which generates a Prisma Client in JavaScript
  or TypeScript. This client provides type-safe and auto-generated code for
  interacting with your database. It's the go-to choice for about 99% of
  projects.
- However, Prisma allows for flexibility and customization. For example, if
  you're building a GraphQL API, you can use a different generator tailored to
  GraphQL. This generator can automatically produce code that aligns with your
  GraphQL schema.
- In summary, Prisma generators enable you to define your database schema in a
  Prisma-specific format and then generate code or files based on that schema.
  While the default generator suits most use cases, Prisma's flexibility allows
  you to choose different generators to adapt to your specific project
  requirements.

## Prisma Model:

Models in Prisma represent the tables in your database where you store your
data. Each model is made up of multiple fields, and each field has several
components:

1. **Name**: This is the first and straightforward part of a field. It defines
   what the field is called. For example, you can have an "ID" field, a "name"
   field, or an "email" field.
2. **Type**: The type specifies the data type that the field can hold. For
   instance, you can have an integer field, a string field, or other data types
   depending on your requirements.
3. **Optional Field Modifier**: After the field name and type, you have the
   option to include a field modifier. For example, if you want to indicate that
   a field is optional, you can add a question mark (e.g., `name: String?`).
   This means that the "name" field is not required and can be left blank.
4. **Attributes**: Attributes are optional and are denoted with the "@" symbol.
   They provide additional information about the field. For example, the "ID"
   field can have attributes such as `@id` and `@default(autoincrement())`.
   These attributes define the field's properties, like making it the primary
   key and specifying a default auto-incrementing value.

Prisma supports various field type modifiers and attributes to allow you to
tailor the behavior of your fields to your application's requirements.

**\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***Example:**\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***

- To create a sample Prisma model for a **`User`**, you would define it in your
  **`schema.prisma`** file. Here's an example Prisma model for a **`User`**

```tsx
model User {
  id        Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  username  String    @unique
  email     String    @unique
  name      String
  posts     Post[]
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime  @updatedAt
}
```

Required aspects to consider when creating a Prisma model:

- **Model Name**: You must provide a unique name for your model, such as
  **`User`** in this case.
- **Fields**: Define the fields that your model should have. Specify their data
  types (e.g., **`Int`**, **`String`**, **`DateTime`**) and any constraints
  (e.g., **`@unique`**) that apply.
- **Primary Key**: It's a good practice to specify a primary key for your model
  using the **`@id`** attribute.
- **Relations**: If your model has relationships with other models, you can
  define them using fields like **`posts`** in the example, which establishes a
  relation with the **`Post`** model.
- **Default Values**: You can set default values for fields using the
  **`@default`** attribute, as shown with **`createdAt`**.
- **Timestamps**: If you want to track timestamps, you can use **`createdAt`**
  and **`updatedAt`** fields with **`@default(now())`** and **`@updatedAt`**,
  respectively.

This Prisma model definition is a crucial part of your data schema, and it
allows you to work with the data in a type-safe manner using the Prisma Client.
Once you define your models, you can use Prisma's migration system to create
database tables based on these models.

## Prisma Migration:

When defining a model in Prisma, it's important to understand that Prisma and
your database operate separately. Defining a model in Prisma doesn't immediately
affect your database; they remain disconnected. To bridge this gap and apply the
schema changes to your database, you need to create a migration.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to create a migration to sync your
Prisma model with your database:

1. **Model Definition**: Your initial step, as you've correctly done, is to
   define the model in Prisma, outlining the fields and their characteristics.
2. **Create a Migration**: To bring your database in line with your Prisma
   schema, you must generate a migration. This is where you tell Prisma that
   you're done making schema changes and it's time to update your database. To
   do this, use the following command, providing an optional name for your
   migration (e.g., "init"). Ensure you specify that this is for your
   development environment:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

   The "dev" tag signifies that you're working in a development environment

3. **Migration Process**: After executing the command, Prisma will generate a
   new migration file. This migration file contains instructions on how to
   interact with your database, applying the changes necessary to align it with
   your Prisma schema.
4. **Database Synced**: Once the migration process is complete, your database
   will be synchronized with your Prisma schema, including the new "User" model.
5. **Migrations Folder**: Prisma stores these migration files in a designated
   "migrations" folder, making it easy to manage and track changes over time.

This migration process allows you to evolve your database schema in a controlled
and organized manner, ensuring that your Prisma-defined models are properly
reflected in your database structure.

### Prisma Client:

Each time we create a migration,essentially, we've created a new Prisma Client,
and this client corresponds to the generator we defined earlier. In our case,
we've specified the **`prisma-client-js`** generator. The purpose of this client
is to automatically generate code that enables us to interact with our database.
So, whenever we make changes to our schema, like adding a new model, Prisma
updates the client code accordingly.

Based on the previously two points mentioned, here’s a recap:

1. **Prisma Client**: The Prisma Client is a critical component generated by
   Prisma based on your schema definition. It serves as the interface between
   your application code and your database. When you modify your schema through
   migrations or add new models, Prisma ensures that the client code is updated
   to reflect these changes.
2. **Migrations and Client Updates**: Each time you create a migration, Prisma
   also updates your Prisma Client. This means that the client code is always
   synchronized with your database structure. In the context of your "User"
   model, Prisma automatically generates the necessary client code to interact
   with user data. This code includes operations for creating, reading,
   updating, and deleting user records. The best part is that this code is
   type-safe, thanks to TypeScript.

Now we require Prisma Client:

1. Install the Prisma Client Library by running the command:

   ```bash
   npm i @prisma/client
   ```

   This command installs the Prisma Client, which is essential for generating
   and using the client code.

2. After the initial installation via the migration, all the necessary code is
   already generated. However, if you ever need to manually regenerate your
   Prisma Client code, you can do so by running:

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

   This command regenerates the Prisma Client code based on your Prisma schema,
   using the provider settings.

3. Now, with the Prisma Client in place, you can start using it in your
   application code. The Prisma Client was automatically generated and stored in
   a specific location, making it accessible for database interactions.

## Prisma Types:

Let's explore various field types that Prisma supports. There's a wide range of
field types available:

1. **Integer**: An integer field represents whole numbers without decimal
   places. It's used for storing values like IDs, counts, or any numeric data
   without fractions.

   ```tsx
   quantity Int
   ```

2. **String**: Fields of type string are used for storing text data. They can
   represent various types of textual information, such as names, titles, and
   descriptions.

   ```tsx
   title String
   ```

3. **Boolean**: A field of type Boolean can represent values like true or false.
   It's used to handle binary choices.

   ```tsx
   isAdmin Boolean
   ```

4. **BigInt**: This field type is for handling large integer values, typically
   larger than the standard integer type.

   ```
   largeNumber BigInt
   ```

5. **Float**: Fields of type Float are used for representing decimal numbers or
   numbers with fractional parts.

   ```
   rating Float
   ```

6. **Decimal**: Similar to Float, Decimal represents decimal numbers but
   provides more precision for accurate floating-point values. It's ideal when
   you need precision.

   ```
   preciseValue Decimal
   ```

7. **DateTime**: This type handles date and time values, including timestamps.
   It's suitable for fields like creation or modification timestamps.

   ```
   createdAt DateTime
   updatedAt DateTime
   ```

8. **JSON**: Fields of type JSON store structured data in JSON format. Not all
   databases support this type, so ensure compatibility with your database.

   ```
   preferences Json
   ```

9. **Bytes**: This type is used for storing raw binary data, such as file
   content. It's suitable for cases where data needs to be stored in binary
   format.

   ```
   fileContent Bytes
   ```

10. **Unsupported**: Prisma allows you to import existing databases and convert
    them to a schema. If the database includes unsupported data types in Prisma,
    these types will be marked as "unsupported."

    ```
    unsupportedField Unsupported("#Type")
    ```

It's important to choose the appropriate field type based on your data
requirements. Prisma's flexibility in supporting different field types allows
you to tailor your database schema to your application's needs.

## Prisma Field Attributes:

### Block Level Attributes:

In Prisma, you have the flexibility to use block-level attributes to define
constraints and configurations that apply to multiple fields within a model.
These attributes offer broader control over the entire model or groups of
fields. Let's delve into some significant block-level attributes:

1. **Uniqueness Constraint**:

   - You can enforce uniqueness constraints on combinations of fields. For
     instance, to ensure that no two users share the same age and name, you can
     define a uniqueness constraint like this:

     ```
     model User {
       id      Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
       name    String
       age     Int
       email   String
       @@unique([age, name])
     }

     ```

   This code signifies that within the "User" model, the combination of "age"
   and "name" must be unique. It prevents two users from having the same age and
   name.

2. **Indexes**:

   - Prisma allows you to define indexes for performance optimization and
     efficient querying. You can create an index on specific fields, improving
     sorting and query performance. For example, you can create an index on the
     "email" field like this:

     ```
     model User {
       id      Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
       name    String @unique
       age     Int
       email   String @unique
     	@@index([email])
     }

     ```

   This code introduces an index on the "email" field, which enhances query
   performance when filtering or sorting based on email addresses.

3. **Composite ID**:

   - Prisma provides the option to create composite IDs, where an ID is derived
     from a combination of multiple fields. In the example below, the "ID" is
     defined as a combination of the "title" and "author ID." This signifies
     that the uniqueness of a post is determined by both its title and the
     author's ID.

     ```
     model Post {
       title    String
       authorId Int
       @@id([title, authorId])
     }

     ```

   This approach is different from the traditional auto-generated ID and offers
   fine-grained control over unique identification.

These block-level attributes provide a powerful way to define constraints and
configurations that apply to groups of fields within your model, enhancing the
expressiveness and control of your Prisma schema.

## How to handle relationships in Prisma?

### One-Many Relationships:

Let's create a model named "Post" and establish a relationship with the "User"
model:

```tsx
model User {
  id        Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  username  String    @unique
  email     String    @unique
  name      String
  posts     Post[]
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime  @updatedAt
}

model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String
  author    User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
}
```

In Prisma, relationships between models are defined using the **`@relation`**
attribute. In the "Post" model, the **`author`** field is annotated with
**`@relation`**, which specifies the relation's details:

- **`fields: [authorId]`**: This array lists the fields in the "Post" model that
  are used to reference the related record in the "User" model. In this case,
  it's the **`authorId`** field.
- **`references: [id]`**: This array indicates the fields in the "User" model
  that are being referenced by the **`author`** field in the "Post" model. Here,
  it references the **`id`** field of the "User" model.

This relationship creates a connection between a post and its author. For each
post, the **`author`** field references a user from the "User" model. Users can
have multiple posts associated with them (one-to-many), as indicated by the
**`posts`** field in the "User" model.

### Multiple Relations between Models:

If you want to establish multiple relationships between the same models, such as
"User" and "Post," you'll need to disambiguate these relationships to avoid
ambiguity. Let's take the example of a user having two types of relationships
with posts: "written posts" and "favorite posts”:

```tsx
model User {
  id        Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  username  String    @unique
  email     String    @unique
  name      String
  posts     Post[]
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime  @updatedAt
  writtenPosts   Post[]   @relation("writtenPosts", fields: [id])
  favoritePosts  Post[]   @relation("favoritePosts", fields: [id])
}

model Post {
  id              Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title           String
  content         String
  author           User     @relation("writtenPosts", fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId        Int
  favoritedBy      User[]   @relation("favoritePosts")
}
```

By providing distinct names for the relationships and specifying those names in
the **`@relation`** attribute, you resolve any potential ambiguity when multiple
relationships are established between the same models. This enables Prisma to
generate the necessary queries and relationships without confusion.

### Many-Many Relationships:

```tsx
model Category {
  id       Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  name     String
  posts    Post[]
}

model Post {
  id          Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  title       String
  content     String
  categories  Category[]
}
```

In this configuration:

- The "Category" model includes a field **`posts`** that is an array of posts.
  This establishes a many-to-many relationship between categories and posts.
- The "Post" model includes a field **`categories`** that is also an array of
  categories. Prisma automatically recognizes this as a many-to-many
  relationship and generates the necessary join table to link posts and
  categories.

Prisma streamlines the creation of many-to-many relationships, handling the
complexities of the join table for you. You don't need to set up additional
configurations or write custom join tables, making it more efficient and
developer-friendly.

### One-One Relationships:

Let's discuss a one-to-one relationship in Prisma. In this example, we'll set up
a scenario where one user is associated with one set of user preferences, and
instead of using a JSON field, we'll create a separate model called
"UserPreference.”:

```tsx
model User {
  id          Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  username    String    @unique
  email       String    @unique
  name        String
  age         Int?
  preferences  UserPreference?
}

model UserPreference {
  id             Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  emailUpdates   Boolean
  user           User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId         Int
}
```

- In the "User" model, we introduce a field named **`preferences`**, which
  represents the one-to-one relationship between a user and their preferences.
  We use the **`?`** modifier to indicate that this field is optional, meaning
  that a user may or may not have associated preferences.
- In the "UserPreference" model, we define the fields related to user
  preferences, such as **`emailUpdates`** to indicate if the user wants to
  receive email updates. Additionally, we establish a relation to the "User"
  model using the **`user`** field, connecting it to the **`userId`** field in
  the "UserPreference" model.

## Enums:

Prisma ensures that you can only assign values that match the enum, preventing
unexpected or invalid values for the "role" field. Enums offer a clean and
structured way to manage predefined values in your schema, making it easier to
maintain data integrity and consistency in your application.

```tsx
enum Role {
  basic
  admin
  editor
}

model User {
  id   Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name String
  role Role   @default(basic)
}
```

## Prisma Methods:

```jsx
const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: "Person",
  },
});

console.log(newUser);
```

### CreateMany:

```tsx
const users = await prisma.user.createMany({
  data: [
    {
      name: "Person1",
      age: 20,
    },
    {
      name: "Person2",
      age: 30, // Specify the age for Sally
    },
  ],
});
```

### FindUnique:

```tsx
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: {
    email: "person@test.com", // You specify the unique key for your search
  },
  select: {
    // Use select to specify the fields you want to retrieve
    id: true,
    name: true,
    email: true,
    // Include other fields as needed
  },
});

const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: {
    age_name: {
      // provided you have a uniqueness contraint for age and name
      age: 27,
      name: "Person",
    },
  },
});
```

### FIndFirst:

```tsx
const user = await prisma.user.findFirst({
  where: {
    name: "person2",
  },
});
```

```tsx
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    age: 30, // Filter by the age property
  },
  orderBy: {
    age: "desc", //sorting
  },
  take: 2, // take first two people
  skip: 1, // skip one person
});
```

### Update:

```tsx
const updatedUser = await prisma.user.update({
  where: {
    email: "person1@test.com",
  },
  data: {
    email: "person1@test3.com",
  },
});
```

### UpdateMany:

```tsx
const updatedUsers = await prisma.user.updateMany({
  where: {
    name: "person",
  },
  data: {
    email: "person1@test3.com",
  },
});
```

### Delete:

```tsx
const deletedUser = await prisma.user.delete({
  where: {
    email: "person@test.com", //note: the field must be unique
  },
});
```

### DeleteMany:

```tsx
await prisma.user.deleteMany();
```
